# Coursework_1_ANN
Biologically Inspired Computation(F20BC/F21BC) Coursework 1 - Artificial Neural Network

What you are asked to do:1.Implement a multi-layer ANN architecture
2.Train the ANN to fita specified dataset
3.Investigate how hyperparameters affect the ability of an ANNto fit this dataset
4.Write a short report and submit both the reportand your code to Canvas
5.Sign the “Coursework Group Signing Sheet” and submitwith your work

1. Implement a multi-layer ANN architecture

You should implement a simple feedforward multilayer architecture.Both the number of neurons in  each  layer  and  the  number  of  layers  should  be  configurable. You  will  need  to  implement  both forward pass andbackpropagationfor the ANN.Hereis alist of activation functions that should be implemented, though you may alsoinvestigate other suitable functions:

Sigmoid , Tanh(x), Relu

2.Train the ANN to fit a specified
